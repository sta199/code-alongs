# Introduction

## Goal

The following chart was [shared](https://x.com/GraphCrimes/status/1566264004288331776) by @GraphCrimes on X/Twitter on September 3, 2022.

Our ultimate goal in this code along is to identify aspects of misrepresentation in this plot and then to correct them.

## Packages

We will use the **tidyverse** package for data wrangling and visualization.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

These data come from [Survation](https://www.survation.com/) and were recreated from the percentages noted on the segmented bar chart above.

```{r}
#| label: load-population-data
#| message: false
survation <- read_csv("https://data-science-with-r.github.io/data/survation.csv")
```

Let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
#| label: view-survation-data
survation
```

# Analysis

## Critique

What is misleading about this graph?

## Recreate and improve

-   Confirm that the data match the percentages from the visualization. That is, calculate the percentages of public sector, private sector, donâ€™t know for each of the services and check that they match the percentages from the plot.

```{r}
#| label: calculate-percentages
# add code here
```

-   Create an improved version of the visualization. Your improved visualization:

- should also be a segmented bar chart with services on the y-axis and presented in the same order as the original plot; sectors should create segments of the plot using the same colors (`gray`, `#FF3205`, and `#006697`) and appear in the same order as the original plot

- should have the same legend location

- should have the same title and caption

- does not need to have a bolded title or a gray background

- does not need to show percentages in the segments

```{r}
#| label: recreate
# add code here
```

-   How does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?
